<p>Hello <%= @resource.email %>!</p>

<p>Someone (hopefully you) has requested to reset your password at the Steam Support helpdesk. If you did not request
  this reset, please ignore this message.</p>

<p><%= link_to t('devise.passwords.change'), edit_password_url(@resource, reset_password_token: @token) %></p>

<p>When you visit the above page (which you must do within 24 hours), you will be prompted to enter a new password.
  After you have submitted the form, you can log in normally using the new password you set.
</p>
